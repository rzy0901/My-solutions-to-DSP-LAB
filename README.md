+ You could refer to it but should not copy it. :smirk:
+ If you are studying this course, you'd better to add an introduction and a summary to your each report.(I have been punished for this with ten points for each report.)
+ When it comes to analyze a problem, make your mathematical equations as more as possible to earn more points. (Damn settings for this lab.)
+ Most reports were written by MARKDOWN. From LAB5, I started using LATEX.(To get my template and instructions, please refer to <https://github.com/rzy0901/MyLatexTemplate>).
+ Good Luck, young Communication-Engineering people!
